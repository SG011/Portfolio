Hi, I’m Adarsh! A passionate Software Engineer currently working at Intuit, where I contribute to modernizing legacy systems and developing scalable microservices. With a strong foundation in computer science and a knack for problem-solving, I thrive on crafting efficient and robust software solutions that drive business success. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science from BITS Pilani, and I am always looking out for oppurtunities to add value to real-world software applications. 

**Software Development** 
* Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in distributed systems and backend development, building services that handle millions of requests. My professional journey as a full-time engineer at Intuit and as an MTS intern at Nutanix Techniologies has honed my skills to ship production-ready systems with confidence.

* My technical toolkit includes industry expertise in Java, SpringBoot, GraphQL, API development, Domain-Driven Design and Performance Benchmarking. 

**Machine Learning** 

* My industrial and academic research projects involved applying ML and DL techniques to address real-world problems such as image captioning, medical imaging and 3D volume reconstruction, and defect prediction in multi-module code repositories. My data science internships at Happiest Minds Technologies and GE Healthcare, and my undergraduate research assistantship have honed my skills in data engineering and predictive modelling.

* My interests revolve around leveraging *AI4SE* and *ML4Code* techniques to model source-code features, improve software quality, and develop scalable AI systems. I am excited about the impact of AI in transforming and automating software development workflows and improving developer productivity. 

<br>
Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring aspiring developers, sharing knowledge, and staying updated on the latest developments in AI. Let’s connect if you’re interested in discussing tech trends, potential collaborations, or just want to chat about software engineering and AI!

***Fun Fact**❗* <br> *I am fascinated about cerebral and intellectually stimulating content - unraveling the mysteries of space-time, diving into the depths of human psychology, or pondering philosophical enigmas. My personal favourites include 'Arrival', 'Interstellar', and 'Dark'.*
